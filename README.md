# BoulderBlast-Game

Boulder blast is a game that was build using the OpenGL library and C++.

This game allows a user to run around a maze and once all the blue gems are collected, the exit appears and the user can leave the level 
to the next level.

Also, the user can't run over holes, but can fill the holes by moving boulders to make them dissappear.
Player can shoot using the space bar, and kill the robots, which shoot back!

Have fun!!!
